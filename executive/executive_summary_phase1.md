# Executive Summary – Phase 1

**Project:** Secure AI Fraud Detection Pipeline  
**Phase:** Week 1 – Use Case, Market, and Regulatory Groundwork  
**Prepared by:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** [Insert Date]

## 1. Purpose

The first phase of this project lays the regulatory, business, and technical foundation for a GDPR-, PSD2-, and AI Act-compliant fraud detection pipeline in the EU banking sector.

## 2. Objectives

- Define realistic fraud detection use cases (CNP fraud, login anomalies, transaction spikes)
- Analyze regulatory impact (PSD2, GDPR, AI Act)
- Quantify the fraud detection market in EU banking
- Develop the initial synthetic dataset and fraud simulation strategy
- Identify key stakeholders and their compliance needs (CISO, DPO, Auditor)

## 3. Key Deliverables

- `business_use_case.md`  
- `psd2_mapping_table.md`  
- `gdpr_mapping_table.md`  
- `ai_act_ce_declaration_draft.md`  
- Synthetic fraud dataset prototype

## 4. Stakeholder Relevance

| Stakeholder | Value Provided                                     |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| CISO        | Clear model objectives and security boundaries      |
| DPO         | Privacy impact and data minimization strategy       |
| Regulator   | Evidence of legal alignment with PSD2/GDPR/AI Act   |
| ML Engineer | Clear scope of use case and data preparation rules  |

## 5. Business Impact

- Enables accurate detection of high-risk fraud events  
- Supports PSD2-compliant SCA exemption logic  
- Reduces potential GDPR penalties via privacy-first architecture  
- Provides early-stage documentation for CE conformity simulation

## 6. Strategic Alignment

This phase supports the career positioning of the project author toward a Senior AI Security Architect role by demonstrating capabilities in:

- Use Case Design  
- Regulatory Mapping  
- Stakeholder Communication  
- Audit-Ready Documentation

## 7. Next Steps

- Develop the anomaly detection model (Isolation Forest)  
- Implement Privacy-by-Design techniques (DP, k-Anonymity)  
- Initiate stakeholder communication templates
