# Business Use Case: Secure AI Fraud Detection in European Banking

## 1. Executive Summary

This project implements an AI-powered fraud detection system tailored for the European banking sector, with a strong emphasis on security, explainability, and regulatory compliance (PSD2, GDPR, EU AI Act). The pipeline targets transaction-based anomalies such as card fraud, account takeovers, and login anomalies, using unsupervised machine learning models (Isolation Forest) and privacy-preserving techniques.

## 2. Business Context

### Industry
- Retail & Commercial Banking  
- EU-regulated Financial Institutions

### Challenge
- Banks face significant financial and reputational losses from fraud (~€1.8B/year in the EU).
- Regulatory mandates require strong customer authentication (SCA) and real-time fraud detection (PSD2 Art. 97).
- Traditional rule-based systems suffer from high false positives and delayed detection.
