# Project Overview - Secure AI Fraud Detection Pipeline

## Purpose
This repository is a learning and portfolio project that simulates how an AI-based fraud detection system can be designed for a regulated EU banking environment.

The goal is not production readiness or legal compliance. The goal is to demonstrate:
- structured ML engineering thinking,
- security and privacy awareness,
- audit-ready documentation and artifacts.

All data used in this project is synthetic.

## Problem Statement (Simulated)
Financial institutions must detect suspicious transactions early while complying with:
- GDPR data protection rules,
- PSD2 security and monitoring obligations,
- emerging AI governance requirements (EU AI Act).

This project simulates that challenge by building a fraud detection pipeline from raw events to model-ready features.

## Pipeline Overview
High-level flow:
1. Data ingestion and validation.
2. Data cleaning (`notebooks/01_data_cleaning.ipynb`).
3. Feature engineering (`notebooks/02_feature_engineering.ipynb`).
4. Training and evaluation (`notebooks/03_model_training.ipynb`).
5. Monitoring and governance documentation.

## Design Principles
- Security-by-Design
- Privacy-by-Design
- Audit readiness

## Target Audience
Recruiters, security-aware data science teams, and learners interested in regulated ML systems.
